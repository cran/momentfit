\title{Subsetting methods}
\description{
Different subsetting methods for S4 class objects of the package. The
subset method returns an new object with observations selected by the
second argument. See example.

\item{\code{signature(x = "momentWeights", i = "integer", j = "missing")}}{
  It creates a partition from the weighting matrix. 
}

\item{\code{signature(x = "momentWeights", i = "missing", j = "missing")}}{  
  It generates the whole weighting matrix. 
}


\item{\code{signature(x = "sysMomentWeights", i = "missing", j = "list")}}{
  It creates a partition from the weighting matrix. j has no effect
  here.  It creates a partition from the weighting matrix in a systemof  
  equations. i selects the equation and the list j the moments in each
  equation. Missing i means all equations.
}

\item{\code{signature(x = "sysMomentWeights", i = "numeric", j =
    "missing")}}{
    It creates a partition from the weighting matrix. j has no effect
  here.  It creates a partition from the weighting matrix in a systemof  
  equations. i selects the equation and the list j the moments in each
  equation. Missing j means all moments.
}

\item{\code{signature(x = "sysMomentWeights", i = "missing", j = "missing")}}{
  No effect. It returns x.
}


\item{\code{signature(x = "snonlinearModel", i = "numeric", j="missing")}}{
  It generates a system of equations with a subset of equations selected
  by i. If the number of remaining equations is one, it returns an
  object of class \code{"nonlinearGmm"}.
}


\item{\code{signature(x = "slinearModel", i = "numeric", j="missing")}}{
  It generates a system of equations with a subset of equations selected
  by i. If the number of remaining equations is one, it returns an
  object of class \code{"linearModel"}.
}

\item{\code{signature(x = "rslinearModel", i = "numeric", j="missing")}}{
  It is only use to select one equation when no cross-equation
  restrictions are imposed. Only one equation can be selected. 
}

\item{\code{signature(x = "sysMomentModel", i = "numeric", j="list")}}{
  It generates a system of equations with a subset of equations selected
  by i and a subset of moment conditions selected by j. If the number of
  remaining equations is one, it returns an object of class \code{"linearGmm"}.
}

\item{\code{signature(x = "sysMomentModel", i = "missing", j="missing")}}{
  No effect. It returns x.
}


\item{\code{signature(x = "momentModel", i = "missing", j = "missing")}}{
Returns the model without any change.
}

\item{\code{signature(x = "functionModel", i = "numeric", j = "missing")}}{
  It generates the same model with a subset of the moment conditions.
}

\item{\code{signature(x = "formulaModel", i = "numeric", j = "missing")}}{
  It generates the same model with a subset of the moment conditions.
}

\item{\code{signature(x = "rfuncionModel", i = "numeric", j = "missing")}}{
  It generates the same model with a subset of the moment conditions. j
  has no effect here.
}
